Tired of long and unnecessary process of logging in to STARS? Login to STARS SRS with one click with this awesome app!
# Installation
**Chrome:** [Download](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) webdriver and put it to C:\Windows. If you use Linux download .zip from same link and then run: 
```unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
chmod +x chromedriver

sudo mv -f chromedriver /usr/local/share/chromedriver
sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/chromedriver /usr/local/bin/chromedriver
sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver
```
**Firefox:** [Download](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) geckodriver and put it to C:\Windows. If you use Linux, put it to /usr/local/bin.

For **Windows** users:
  1. Go [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of python 3. You should've done that a long ago!
  2. Run cmd **as an administrator** and type `pip install selenium`
  3. Go to the releases of this project(up there, look carefully) and download .exe file
  4. Make sure you put stars.jpg and icon.ico in the same folder as .exe file.
  5. Now **SMASH** that Star button and enjoy automation!
  
For **Linux** users:
  1. I guess you already have python3. If not, uninstall Linux right now.
  2. Type `sudo python3 -m pip install -U selenium` and `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
  3. Go to the releases of this project(you know where it is) and download some file that you can run.
  4. Make sure you put stars.jpg and executable in the same folder.
  5. Now **SMASH** that Star button and enjoy what you've always enjoyed!
  
For **Mac** users:
  Idk, I'm not rich.
